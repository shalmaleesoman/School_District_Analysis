# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

**The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the data of an entire school district. The specifics that were analyzed were student grades and funding throughout the schools. After the work in the module, the school board was notified that there was academic dishonesty, and we were asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact.**

## Results 

After replacing the ninth graders scores with "NaN" it was concluded that:

*the overall passing percentage for Thomas High School fell to 65%

*the overall passing percentage for the entire district fell to 64.9%

When the scores were ommitted from their calculations

*the overall passing percentages decreased by .11 percent.

*the average scores of Thomas High School for math and reading _increased_ by .06.

## School Budget and School Size

### Budget

As spending per student increases, average scores and passing percentages do not increase. This shows that funding does not affect average student scores. In fact, it is the opposite as shown in the picture below.

### Size

When looking at school sizes, the numbers they are based on is shown in the chart below. Larger schools seem to have the lowest passing percentages and this could be because larger schools tend to be district schools, which is parallel to the findings shown in charter and district schools.

By replacing those grades with NaNs, Thomas High Schools percentages dropped **in all areas**, compared to the initial results. In the original analysis, before academic dishonesty, Thomas High School was in the top 5 schools, but after conducting new results, Thomas High School lost their spot.
